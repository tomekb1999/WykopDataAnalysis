This is a simple educational project in which I perform basic data analysis of posts from the social media service Wykop.pl:
-   In the <code>load_data.ipynb</code> notebook, I download the data using the Wykop API and save it in CSV files for further analysis.
-   The created files are stored in a <code>data</code> folder.
-   Then, in the notebook called <code>analysis.ipynb</code>, I perform the actual exploration.
